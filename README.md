Summary:
Providing a solution to keeping the record of donors and recipeints in the area of aid donation open and transparent.

This solution tackles the problem of finding relations between donors and recipients. We propose a data management
solution which would store information about donors and recipeints of aid in three primary levels Government, Aid
organization, and Individual. Every donation will be followed to the lowest level it achieves. So if a donation starts
from a donor individual DI1 to and Donor Organization DO1. The donation goes from DO1 to a Reciever Organization 
RO1(Where DO1 can be the equal to RO1). If there is no record of this donation moving finally to an individual then 
this is the last point. However, if the donation was finally provided to a receiver Individual RI1, then through 
the organization RO1 and DO1 the donation from DI1 has a relation to RI1.

These relations will show the end user a simple view to where his donation ends up. This is a database and backend
computational intensive task.
